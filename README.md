# Overview 

I have developed a roboadvisor that provides investment portfolio recommendations for retirement. The Roboadvisor is build on Amazon Lex that establishes conversation with the client who is seeking advise on investment. I have also used lambda funtion to enhance the capability of the robo to handle the error scenarios and process the inputs provided by the user. 


# Technologies 

Python is the primary language used to code this application. Amazon Lex services is used to create the bot instance. Amazon lambda funtion is utilized to manipulate the input provided by the user. 



This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Amazon Lex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) - Amazon Lex services to build the box
* [Amazon Lambda ](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Amazon Lambda to enchance the capabilities of the bot instance
